this is a dictionary
    use braces to create it 
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
\
\
this will call the caller and it will respond with green
print(alien_0['color'])
out: green

it organise the code so it is easier to track
new_points = alien_0['points']
print("You just earned " + str(new_points) + " points!")
